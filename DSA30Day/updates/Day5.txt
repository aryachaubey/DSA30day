Hi it's Day5 and this is what I've learned  : 

static :  static variables are those variables that are the properties that are not directly related to an object 
          but are common to all the objects created with the help of particular class.

--> to access a static variable correctly we use the class name and that 
    static variable property.

note :  static variables are common to everyone and they don't depend upon 
       any objects , it can still work if there are Zero objects being 
       created.


A very important use case of the static keyword is the - public static void main()

why we use static in psvm ? 

 Because in java we deal with classes and if we want to do anything or
 access any function or property in that class we have to create an object  for it , but this does'nt goes with the static keyword .

the static in the psvm statment simply means that we can access or use the main function or our entry point of any any java programm without creating any object of it , because as we know in classes we first have to create objects of that class to use their properties and functions .

One more thing about static is that wherever static keyword is used with a function you cannot use function inside it which 
is not static.


Okay so - if we want to access a non-static data inside of a static function we first have to specify the class to which that  non static data belongs to and then have to create an object for it first.

but why we cannot use non-static inside of a static one : 

It is because static data are object independent and non-static data are object dependent.
