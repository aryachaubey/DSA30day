Hi it's Day 16 and Here's what I've learned  :

Access modifiers : 

Under access control in Java there are three access modifiers that we need to know : 

(i) public : 

If we are making any data member public that means we can access that data member in any other class also or 
basically anywhere.

 for  Example : 

 class A{ 

  public int a;
  int b;

  }

class Main { 

public static void main()  {

 A a = new A ();

 a.a = 12;
  }
}
sout(a) ; 
 output  : 12 

So , here we are able to access and modify the value of a which is a data member of the class A because it is specified as a 
     public member .



(ii)  private :

   The next type of access modifier is private . SO , By any chance if we are making any data member of a class private that 
   basically means that we cannot access that member anywhere else instead inside the particular class in which it has been initialized.


For Example : 

 class A  {

 private int a ;
 int b; 

 public void getnum (){

   this.a = 25;
  return a;
   }

  }


class Main { 

public static void main()  {

 A a  = new A();

a.a = 24;   // now this line is going to give us an error because we have already specified our data member to be a private member so we 
              cannot use it inside our main  class.


sout(a.getnum());   // but this thing is going to work because in this we are trying to access the value of that data member through a getter function\
                      which itself is a public member .

  }

}




Now one more interesting thing  :

 Now what if we do not specify anything to any data member than who is gonna have the access control over those data members ? 

So , If we have'nt specified the access of a particular data member than only the classes inside a same package can access those data members,

but if any class from any other package is trying to access that data member than java will flash us an error.
