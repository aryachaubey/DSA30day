Hi it's Day13 and Here's what I've learned  : 


-- types of polumorphism continues : 

(ii) Runtime polymorphism / Dynamic polymorphism :

  note : This type of polymorphism is achieved by method overriding.

so method overriding basically means that whenever there is a method inside of a child class that
have the exact same name as the one which is present in the parent or the base class( everything is same : just the body is different )
