Hi it's Day20 and Here's what I've learned :


Abstract methods : when we are just creating a function or method with only the definition of it without specifying the content of 
                   its body and their body is completely dependent upon their child classes then such methods are called as abstract  
                   classes .


syntax of converting a method into an abstarct methods 

 abstract void career (String name ) ;

  --> these abstract methods are usually reffered as the responsibilties of the child classes because the parent class does not have anycontent
    or the body for the abstarct method.
