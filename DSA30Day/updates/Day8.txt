Hi its's Day8 and Here's what I've learned : 

 OOP --  So OOP stands for Object-Oriented programming  which is a type of programming in which we divide our code into chunks 
         or parts to make it more accessible and more managable that helps us to do debbuging and all other stuffs more efficiently.

Properties of OOP --

 There are basically 4 major properties of Object-Orieneted programming 

  (i) Inheritance 
  (ii) Polymorphism
  (iii)Encapsulation
  (iv)Abstraction

  Inheritance :

   parents 
     |
     |
    Childrens    :  Parenets have some properties that children 
                    inherit from them to make use of those properties.
