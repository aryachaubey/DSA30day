Hi its's Day8 and Here's what I've learned : 

 OOP --  So OOP stands for Object-Oriented programming  which is a type of programming in which we divide our code into chunks 
         or parts to make it more accessible and more managable that helps us to do debbuging and all other stuffs more efficiently.

Properties of OOP --

 There are basically 4 major properties of Object-Orieneted programming 

  (i) Inheritance 
  (ii) Polymorphism
  (iii)Encapsulation
  (iv)Abstraction

  Inheritance :

   parents 
     |
     |
    Childrens    :  Parenets have some properties that children 
                    inherit from them to make use of those properties.


---> So there is a concept of Base class and child class in oop


---> So if the base class have some properties than the child class can have access to those properties.
but new properties that are being created in the child class cannot be accessed via the base class(parent class).


 Now the only way using which we can easily incorprate the properties of one class to an another class is through extends 
 keyword .

   class Child extends Base{
   } 
   ---> This simply means that Child class can have the access to all the properties of the Base class with some of it own 
         properties.
