Hi It's Day1 and here's what I've learned :

OOP :  Object Oriented programming 
we've learned about ->
(i) classes : Classes are a named group of properties and functions that acts 
              as a template for creating objects .It is basically a logical construct that helps
              building objects.

(ii) Objects : Objects are very much like a physically entity that occupies some real space(memory) in the computer,
               while classes don't as they are just a structure or set of rules that we are using to make these objects.


Syntax for creating it  : 


             class - >  class Student {
                         int rno,
                         int marks             //This is a class with two properties rno, and marks


               }    

            object -> 

                    Student arya = new Student();      // this is how you create an object from an existing class in this case which is Student


 Here , Student() is a constructor which is a special type of function which is called or invoked whenever an onject is created .
