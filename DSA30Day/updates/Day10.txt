Hi this is Day 10 and here's what I've learned : 

Types of Inheritance  :

 (i) Single inheritance : In this one class extends another class.

 (ii) Multi-level inheritance : In this , One class can inherit the properties of a Base/parent class 
                                and also becomes the parent class for its child class in the below 
                                heirarchy.
