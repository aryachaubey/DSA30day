Hi this is Day 10 and here's what I've learned : 

Types of Inheritance  :

 (i) Single inheritance : In this one class extends another class.
     __________________

 (ii) Multi-level inheritance : In this , One class can inherit the properties of a Base/parent class 
      ________________________  and also becomes the parent class for its child class in the below 
                                heirarchy.

(iii) Multiple inheritance : It means when one class is extending more than one  classes.
      ____________________

 note : Multiple inheritance is not supported in java.

 reason  : If more than two classes have the same variable with different values and if we create an object of the child 
           class and try to access that common variable in the parent class , a confusion will be created that which data or 
           value should be displayed. 


 (iv) Hierarchial inheritance : One class is inherited by many classes .
