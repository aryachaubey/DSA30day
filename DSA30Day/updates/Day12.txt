Hi it's day 12 and here's what I've learned  :

Types of Polymorphism : 

--> Compile-time or Static polymorphism : This type of polymorphism is achieved via method overloading.
  -------------------------------------

  what is mthod overloading ? 

  --> method overloading simply means that when a class have multiple or more than  one function with a same name but different 
      orders or parameters .


 For example - 

  Box(){
  }

  Box(int a , int b){
    
  }

  // SO here are two methods or functions that have the same name but different parameters , one is having no parameter while the other is having 
     two parameters.


  --  This is a example of method overloading .
