Hi it's day 12 and here's what I've learned  :

Types of Polymorphism : 

--> Compile-time or Static polymorphism : This type of polymorphism is achieved via method overloading.
  -------------------------------------

  what is method overloading ? 

  --> method overloading simply means that when a class have multiple or more than  one function or even constructors  with 
    a same name but different 
      orders or parameters .


 For example - 

  Box(){
  }

  Box(int a , int b){
    
  }

  // SO here are two methods or functions that have the same name but different parameters , one is having no parameter 
   while the other is having 
     two parameters.


  --  This is a example of method overloading .


  The reason why it is called compile-time or static 
  polymorphism because java determines that which method or 
  constructor     should be used or displayed.



 difference b/w methods and functions :

 Functions are independent and does not need any object associated with it while methods are such functions which are being 
 associated with any objects and stuff.

 SO method is something which is associated with an object while function is not.
