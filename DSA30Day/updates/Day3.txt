Hi it's Day3 and Here's what I've learned :

So Today we have learned about some keywords that we might encounter while we are implementing OOP 

they are  -- > 

(i) new Keyword
(ii) this Keyword
(iii)final Keyword 

and Finally about Wrapper Classes  -  

So what is a Keyword First of All --- 

A keyword is something that is pre-defined with their own functionalities in every language.

(A) --> new Keyword 
        ____________
  :  A new Keyword is a keyword that is used to create a new object of a particular class

   For Example  :  There is a class named Human  ->


               new
                |
                     |__________|
      Sia <----------|   Human  |
                     |          |             <<- Class
                     |__________| 
                           |
                           |   -> new 
                           |
                          \_/                              : This is how new keyword helps classes in creating objects 
                  Object :  Arya 

more important things about new keyword  :  

  --  So when we create a object with a new keyword so we equate that refeence variable to anyb other variable which, and the special thing is this that we can access that created object from both the reference variables because both the reference variable are pointing to the same object in the heap

   Example - 

Student one  = new Student()
one = two ;

one.name = "shogun";

sout(two.name);
 Output : shogun

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(B) --> this Keyword 
        _____________

 :  this keyword is used to replace the object created from a class inside the definition of a class when we are trying to access
    the property of that class

      for example : 


    Class Student (){

    int marks ;
    int rno; 

    Studnet (){  
        this.marks = 90;
        this.rno= 45;
     }

}

 Explanation : Here's what happening is that when we will create an object of the Student Class 

  like 
   Student Arya  = new Student();

then automically inside the Student Constructor or the special function the object will replace the place of this inside the 
constructor.
 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 (C) ->  final Keyword 

Now final keyword is used and placed as a suffix while creating a variable so that the value of that variable cannot be modified .
But it is only valid in the case of primitive datatypes  

 Example :  
   final int a = 20;
   a = 30;   ---  // this line will give me an error 

 But when we are using final keyword with any non-primitive datatypes like classes which acts just like  a datatype where you can create object's reference variable then we can modify the value of the refence variable of the object .

For Example  : 

 final Student arya = new Student();
  arya.marks = 23;
 // butr you cannot reassign this object to any other object just like we did in line 89 .

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(D)  ->   Wrapper Classes  : 

Wrapper classes are some pre-defined classes in the Java Language that has it pre-defined functions and properties which we 
can use with the help of dot or access notation.

One such Wrapper Class is Integer

 Integer num = new Integer();
 num = 45;

Now num acts as an object of the Wrapper class Integer, and if we want to access any property or function we can just write 
a . and we can access the properties.
