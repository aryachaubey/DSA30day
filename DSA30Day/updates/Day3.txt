Hi it's Day3 and Here's what I've learned :

So Today we have learned about some keywords that we might encounter while we are implementing OOP 

they are  -- > 

(i) new Keyword
(ii) this Keyword
(iii)final Keyword 

and Finally about Wrapper Classes  -  

So what is a Keyword First of All --- 

A keyword is something that is pre-defined with their own functionalities in every language.

(A) --> new Keyword 
        ____________
  :  A new Keyword is a keyword that is used to create a new object of a particular class

   For Example  :  There is a class named Human  ->


               new
                |
                     |__________|
      Sia <----------|   Human  |
                     |          |             <<- Class
                     |__________| 
                           |
                           |   -> new 
                           |
                          \_/                              : This is how new keyword helps classes in creating objects 
                  Object :  Arya 

(B) --> this Keyword 
        _____________

 :  this keyword is used to replace the object created from a class inside the definition of a class when we are trying to access
    the property of that class

      for example : 


    Class Student (){

    int marks ;
    int rno; 

    Studnet (){  
        this.marks = 90;
        this.rno= 45;
     }

}

 Explanation : Here's what happening is that when we will create an object of the Student Class 

  like 
   Student Arya  = new Student();

then automically inside the Student Constructor or the special function the object will replace the place of this inside the 
constructor.
