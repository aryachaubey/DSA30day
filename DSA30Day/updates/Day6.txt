Hi its Day six and here's what I've  learned :

More thing about static  :

(I)as we know static functions and properties are not dependent upon the objects that implies that we cannot use the this keyword in it , as if there will be no objects there than there will be no replacement of any object with the this keyword.


(II)How do we initialize static variables ?

---> using the a static block
Static Block : A static block is a block inside the class that is only executed once whenever the first object if that particular class is created .

 for example - 

   public class StaticBlock {

    static int = 7;
    static int b;

   static {
    sout("Hi I am inside of a static block" )
    b = a*5;
 } 
}  
  
public static void main {

StaticBlock obj = new StaticBlock();
sout(StatticBlock.a + " "+ StaticBlock.b);

StaticBlock +3 = b;
sout(StatticBlock.a + " "+ StaticBlock.b) 
      }
}

output :  Hi I am inside of a static block
          7 35

output :  Hi I am inside of a static Block 
          7 35
          7 38


(III)So here's what's happening is that when we are creating an object obj of StaticBlock class  then the Static block is being executed and we are getting the ouput , but when we are creating an another object of that same class and changing the value of B then only the value of B is being changed without executing that static block again , that implies that static block only runs or executed once whenver the first object is created for that class.

(IV) One more thing about static is that  :  
                 only  Inner classes within an outer class can be static but not any outer class that is having any inner 
                class ca be static.
