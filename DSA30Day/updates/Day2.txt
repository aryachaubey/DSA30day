Hi So it's the Second Day and here's what I 've Learned :

So previously we've discussed about Constructors  - So they are a special type of function that has an exact name like that of a class and they are generally 
called whenever an object is been created  :


  SO for example : 

  we create an object of class Student : 

   It would go like  ->            Student sia = new Student();

Now here Student is a constructor that is been called of while we create an object sia -> 
 But do you know ? what type of Constructor it is -- > 

So its a Default constructor and it is called so because it does not have any parameteres to it.

and if we have parameters inside the constructor it becomes parametereized constructor .


    Let's understand it via an example : 

       class Automobile  { 
 
         int wheels;          // So these are two properties that we have initialized for an object .
         int doors; 


      Automobile ()  {
        this.wheels  = 2;         // So this is a default constructor that when called will set the values of wheels and doors for the particular created object to 
                                     2 and 0 respectively.
        this.doors = 0;
        }
              

       Automobile (int wheels, int doors)  {               // and this is a parametreized constructor that will set the values of wheels and doors to whatever values are passed them
                                                        // as their parameters
        this.wheels = wheels;             
        this.doors = doors;
} 

}






     -----> playing with constructors 


   let's create an object of class Automobile - We' do it two times
 (i) One with Default constructors
 (ii) One with parameterized constructor

        -> Default constructor :    Autombile apache = new Automobile();

sout (apache.wheels)  ; 
output: 2

       -> Parameterized constructor : Automobile Sonet = new Automobile(4,4);
 sout(Sonet.doors);
output: 4
