Hi It's Day4 and Here's what I've learned  : 

One such topic taht we studied today is about Garbage Collection : 

So garbage in a programming languge is something which is just taking some space in the memory but is not having any thing inside 
it or we can say that an object to which no reference variable is pointing , such objects are garbage . 

 So in languages like C++, there can be manual garbage collection , i.e they uses the concept of Destructor.

but Java provides automatic garbage colection with the help of something called Garbage Collector .

So whenever Garbage collection happens it is achieved using a statement which is called Finalization.

So It just frees the memory when objects are destroyed :

 In Java we cannot destroy the objects manually : 

But we can specify what to do when an Object is destroyed

How does it work : ? 

It goes like that whenever the java is doing the Garbage Collection before removing the objects and its stuff just
before that it calls the finalize method which is
being created inside a class only .

---------------------------------------------------

Then we have learned about packages  : 

 Packages  : 

Packages are basically just containers that have classes inside it into compartments 

 com.arya means  - > inside com folder there is an  arya folder .


Why packages are used ?

Use case :  If we want to create two classes with same name welcome we cannot do it inside a single package name , 
So what we can do is we can just create an another package and can make a another class welcome over there also , then we can have 
two classes with same name that can be run for different things or whatever we want to do from it .

One More interesting things about package is that we can access the classes of other package through any other package by 
importing that package
