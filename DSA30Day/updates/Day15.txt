Hi it's Day15 and Here's what I've learned : 

Encapsulation : Encapsulation basically means wrapping up the implementation of the 
                data member and methods in a class.

It basically hides up the code and the data into a single entity so that it can be
secured  or protetcted from the outside world.

mostly , encapsulation is confused with the abstraction .

while ,

Abstarction : Abstarcrion is just hiding details & sharing the valuable information.
___________

For example : when we start the car we just use the key to start it without knowing about the mechanics of a car starting ,
              that means we are not caring about the unncessary information of how to start a car but just starting it what we know
              and is important to start the car.

This  can be a real -world example of an abstraction , In which the uneccessary data is being hidden by the java .


One such thing is there which is known as  abstarct data types in which we  we create their reference variables and just use the methods of 
that datatype or class without bothering about the internal implementation of that method.



Now engineers work upon the internall implementation of these abstract datatypes and create such methods or properties through which 
they are able to provide abstraction  . 



Difference  B/w Abstarction and Encapsulation :

Abstraction is solving an design level issue and the encapsulation is solving an implementation 
level issue.

Abstraction focuses on external stuffs while Encapsulation focuses on the internal implementation.
