Hi today it's day 11 and here's what I've learned :

Polymorphism :  So polymorphism basically means many ways to represent a single entity . 
____________

poly means : many
morphism means : ways to represent

--> polymorphism is a greek word.

Every OOP language should have polymorphism .

It occurs during Inheritance.

For Example : 

So we are creating many classes with same definition of area that will be accessed via the objects created from 
different classes that will ensure the usage of that same area function in different ways.
