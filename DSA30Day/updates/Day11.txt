Hi today it's day 11 and here's what I've learned :

Polymorphism :  So polymorphism basically means many ways to represent a single entity .

poly means : many
morphism means : ways to represent

--> polymorphism is a greek word.

Every OOP language should have polymorphism .

It occurs during Inheritance.
