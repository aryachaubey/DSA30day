 classHi it's Day 9 and here's what I've learned  :

One more thing about inheritance : 

we cannot use those properties even from the Base or the parent class who are already set to private , private basically means that you can access those properties only inside that file only and nowhere else.



Note : ---Child class can access the extra vraibles or properties of the Base class but vice-versa is not possible. 


Important :  One very important thing to understand is this that it depends upon the type of the reference varible but not on the object that determines which members or properties can be accessed.

------------------

super keyword : 

 -- whenever a subclass tries to refer to the parent class from 
  which it is been derived we  use super class

-- It is used more in the case of multi-level inheritance.

Every class that you create has object class as its super class, that means object class is at the top of the heirarchy.
