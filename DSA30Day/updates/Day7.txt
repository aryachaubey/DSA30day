Hi this is Day 7 and here's what I've learned  : 

understanding about - 

System.out.println();

System - is a class
out - is a variable
println - is the function 

Singleton Class - Singleton classes are those classes from which you can only create one 
                  object or instance.

If we want developers not to create more objects than one from a singleton class then we need to stop 
them from using or accessing the Constructors.

-- and we can do so by making the Constructor private that implies we cannot use it in any another class.

In short , Singleton classes basically means that no matter how many instance variables you create from a Singleton Class it will only point to a single object in the memory.



For Example -  


public class SingletonClass { 

   string name;

   private SingletonClass() { 

    }                             // private means ut cannot be used anywhere now 


   private SingletonClass instance ; 

  public SingletonClass getInstance()  { 
  if(instance == null ) {
   SingletonClass = new SingletonClass();
  }
   return SingletonClass;
  }

}

public static void main (){

 SingletonClass obj1 =  SingletonClass.getInstance();
 obj1.name =   "arya";

 SingletonClass obj2 = SingletonClass.getInstance();

Sout(obj1.name);
Sout(obj2.name);

 output : arya
          arya

 - -- - -This implies that both instance variables obj1 and obj2 are pointing towards the same object in the memory , hence no more new objects are being created , and that makes SingletonClass a Singleton class.
