Hi this is Day 7 and here's what I've learned  : 

understanding about - 

System.out.println();

System - is a class
out - is a variable
println - is the function 

Singleton Class - Singleton classes are those classes from which you can only create one 
                  object or instance.

If we want developers not to create more objects than one from a singleton class then we need to stop 
them from using or accessing the Constructors.

-- and we can do so by making the Constructor private that implies we cannot use it in any another class.
